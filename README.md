✅ OPTION 1 — Improve This CNN (recommended)

We can:

1️⃣ Add Dropout

To reduce overfitting and increase validation accuracy.

2️⃣ Add Batch Normalization

Helps model train faster + more stable.

3️⃣ Use more filters

From (32,64) → (32,64,128)

4️⃣ Train longer

10 epochs → 20 or 25.

5️⃣ Use full dataset

Instead of 1000 samples.

✨ If you do the improvements, accuracy will go from:

93% → 98%
